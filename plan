* fifo line echo over uart

section3
uart download to bram with start and stop bytes, or could you already read into ddr?
simple cpu running instructions from ram on stop byte, part of ram is for data

section4
all io is mmio, over axi, triggers waitstate, devices responsible for ending wait with ready byte
read/write, print, hello world over serial
need ddr at this point, consider using a xilinx memory controller, might grow into a real mmu?
talking to phy sounds hard, again consider using an off the self core, axi-stream?, connect to ddr?
